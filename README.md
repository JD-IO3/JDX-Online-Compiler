# JDX-Online-Compiler

## Overview

JDX Online Compiler is a collaborative coding platform aimed at providing an immersive coding experience. Users can code in languages such as C, C++, Java, Python, and C# in a collaborative environment. The project, under active development, is working towards introducing real-time collaboration features using WebSockets.

## Key Features

- Support for C, C++, Java, Python, and C#
- Real-time collaboration (in progress)
- Responsive design for accessibility on various devices (in progress)
- Ongoing work to add support for additional programming languages

## Tech Stack

- React.js for the frontend
- WebSockets (socket.io) for real-time collaboration
- Express.js for server-side operations
- CompileX for compilation support
- Monaco text editor for language writing.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies in both the client and server directories using `npm install`.
3. Add this script in `package.json` of server -> `"server:dev": "nodemon index.js"`
4. Start the client side with `npm run dev` and the server with `npm run server:dev`.
5. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:PORT`.

## Project Status

This project is currently in active development, with a focus on enhancing collaborative coding capabilities. Future updates will include support for more programming languages and innovative features.
